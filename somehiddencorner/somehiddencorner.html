			this video shows the documentation of a website, which might still be online. As it is not particularily self-explanatory I will provide you with a bit more information:
			<p>Instead of gathering people to facilitate communication this work tries to spread them out in a vast virtual space, making communication unlikely but not impossible. In fact the probability of meeting someone on some.hiddencorner.org is almost zero - under the condition that the users binary choices are strictly random. If our binary choices are not the same as the ones generated by a fair coin, people will meet and their messages will become public. Then we can ask: "Why did we meet?" and "What do we say?".</p>
